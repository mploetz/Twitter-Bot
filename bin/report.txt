Report:
Naive will always take the longest and do the most amount of comparisons because it checks every single character.
Then there is tradeoffs between Boyer-Moore and KMP. KMP will have less comparisons and be fast when we compare with a small pattern and a large text, preferably with repeats.
As well KMP only will examine each char only once. Where Boyer-Moore is fast when we have a large pattern and slow when pattern is small.
From my results of testing, I made the pattern small and a large text and I got KMP having fewer comparisons than Boyer-Moore.
Then I made a test with large pattern and large text in which Boyer-Moore had significantly fewer comparisons than KMP.
