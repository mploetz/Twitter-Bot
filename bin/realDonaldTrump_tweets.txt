216.  For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly!
217.  The race for DNC Chairman was, of course, totally "rigged." Bernie's guy, like Bernie himself, never had a chance. Clinton demanded Perez!

252.  The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
253.  FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats - but they are fading fast!
254.  The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers! They will be caught!
255.  Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years. Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!

322.  I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!
323.  Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.
324.  What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!
325.  Enjoy the #SuperBowl and then we continue: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
326.  I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!
327.  Just cannot  believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!
328.  The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!
329.  Interview with @oreillyfactor on Fox Network - 4:00 P.M. (prior to Super Bowl). Enjoy!
330.  Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?

332.  What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
333.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
334.  After being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the FAKE NEWS @nytimes is still lost!
335.  The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
336.  Interesting that certain Middle-Eastern countries agree with the ban. They know if certain people are allowed in it's death & destruction!
337.  When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
338.  Countries charge U.S. companies taxes or tariffs while the U.S. charges them nothing or little.We should charge them SAME as they charge us!

352.  Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!
353.  Iran is rapidly taking over more and more of Iraq even after the U.S. has squandered three trillion dollars there. Obvious long ago!
354.  Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

487.  I win an election easily, a great "movement" is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state!
488.  Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!

528.  So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?

543.  Thank you to Ford for scrapping a new plant in Mexico and creating 700 new jobs in the U.S. This is just the beginning - much more to follow
544.  "@FoxNews: Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage: “It’s very dishonest.” #Hannity https://t.co/ADcPRQifH9" More dishonest than anyone knows
545.  Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!

554.  The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare.
555.  People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY"
556.  General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!

582.  President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost.The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
583.  The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses. 100% of money goes to wonderful charities!

605.  I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!
606.  I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently
607.  Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!

638.  The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
639.  Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
640.  I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
641.  I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!
642.  Presidency. Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them. No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office.
643.  Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the......
644.  I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning.
645.  The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes. The Dems and Green Party can now rest. Scam!

647.  The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.
648.  Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?
649.  Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!
650.  Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there!
651.  Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy!
652.  Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned!
653.  I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON!

659.  A very interesting read. Unfortunately, so much is true.

660.  Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS!
661.  As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun!
662.  I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!
663.  .@RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State".

670.  Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.
671.  If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana. Spend more time working-less time talking. Reduce dues
672.  Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers. No wonder companies flee country!

695.  Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad
696.  Our great VPE, @mike_pence, is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate. John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington.

721.  My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!
722.  Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!
723.  I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse!
724.  The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!
725.  .@CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do.
726.  "@sdcritic:  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary !"
727.  "@FiIibuster: @jeffzeleny Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter.
728.  "@JoeBowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !"  @CNN still doesn't get it. They will never learn!
729.  "@HighonHillcrest: @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN"
730.  Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed!
731.  If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal.
732.  Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!
733.  states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)!
734.  It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--
735.  In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally

742.  Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change
743.  The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore!
744.  The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems
745.  Fidel Castro is dead!

754.  Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years.
755.  The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce?
756.  Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!
757.  I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice
758.  Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job!
759.  Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!

761.  I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news!
762.  General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General!
763.  I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?
764.  Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
765.  The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior
766.  The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!
767.  Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen!
768.  The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
769.  I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
770.  Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
771.  I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
772.  Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
773.  My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
774.  Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
775.  I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
776.  The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
777.  I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
778.  Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
779.  The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
780.  If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
781.  The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
782.  I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
783.  The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
784.  Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
785.  Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
786.  Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
787.  The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
788.  Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
789.  This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!
790.  Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet https://t.co/wPk7QWpK8Z
791.  Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
792.  Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
793.  Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
794.  A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

1435.  Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist.
1436.  Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
1437.  Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con.
1438.  Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!

https://t.co/G5TMAUzy0z
1627.  The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
1628.  Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
1629.  RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
1630.  While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
1631.  Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
1632.  Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!
1633.  Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S!
1634.  "@Stvzbnk: Just Watched @tonyschwartz. Obviously Tony is a Total Whack Job @realDonaldTrump"
1635.  Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible.
1636.  I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope!
1637.  Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted!

1643.  Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny!
1644.  RT @EricTrump: Join @TeamTrump on Saturday for National Day of Action as we work to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/hyclkzPoBR https:/…
1645.  Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
1646.  .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
1647.  The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!
1648.  Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. Thank you! #ImWithYou #MAGA https://t.co/C5ipaxUN7B
1649.  It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail.
1650.  More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. 
#AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain https://t.co/FxyBL6fO1h
1651.  Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/sCOnny1fl3
1652.  With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted.
1653.  Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
1654.  Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
1655.  Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!
1656.  RT @DanScavino: Last nights winner was clear & it will be proven time & time again - lets #MAGA!! Lets WIN!! #TrumpTrain https://t.co/sGqp9…

1675.  "@Ler: Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!"
1676.  Thank you! #AmericaFirst https://t.co/6v4C8ykDVl
1677.  As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
1678.  China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!
1679.  The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!

1684.  Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! https://t.co/FAldS5zZi5
1685.  President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
1686.  "@OSPREY675: @Miami4Trump I followed you because you are a patriot & support @realDonaldTrump, as do I. #MAGA by sticking together.

1689.  "@lblackvelvet: @realDonaldTrump We need to show Americans that Hillary will KILL our Country !! Vote for Trump !!"
1690.  "@CherNuna: @realDonaldTrump It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning! One excuse after another. Then it's this, then it's that.
1691.  Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?
1692.  To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T"
1693.  The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails?
1694.  The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
1695.  The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
1696.  RT @DanScavino: Doesn't fit the MSM narrative - so they wont share what @realDonaldTrump did for Jesse Jackson in 1999 - so I will! https:/…
1697.  "@AnneBellar: @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN is so biased. Never ever watch them. Trump 2016!!"
1698.  Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term!
1699.  Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
1700.  .@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.
1701.  Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

1740.  Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT
1741.  Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere

1784.  Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
1785.  Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
1786.  Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
1787.  So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
1788.  Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!

1803.  President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
1804.  Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
1805.  It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!
1806.  I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime!
1807.  The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!
1808.  .@AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!

1820.  I heard that @Morning_Joe was very nice on Friday but that little Donny D, a big failure in TV (& someone I helped), was nasty. Irrelevant!
1821.  Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her!
1822.  I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening!

1856.  Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets....
Cont: https://t.co/SXp7efXEZU
1857.  This is my pledge to the American people: https://t.co/Jb21oyNfxt
1858.  'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%' https://t.co/EzDzJ4EzIN
1859.  Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans.' Only the beginning! https://t.co/YqfaEvg8c3
1860.  #AmericasMerkel https://t.co/QFRs4bEUC1
1861.  "CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION." https://t.co/COZQNt6KVs
1862.  #MakeAmericaSafeAgain 
https://t.co/bgBGPaKaqI
1863.  Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
1864.  "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
1865.  I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
1866.  It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
1867.  I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
1868.  Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
1869.  My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
1870.  If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
1871.  The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
1872.  The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
1873.  "@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks
1874.  "@PaulaDuvall2: We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice
1875.  "@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!"
1876.  We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
1877.  "@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks
1878.  I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
1879.  The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!
1880.  Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!
1881.  Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania! Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/5hZp7PnRoT
1882.  Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you! #MAGA https://t.co/WNDAagFRRS
1883.  ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State. When will the dishonest media report the facts!
1884.  I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out. They can't!
1885.  A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!
1886.  "@laurencristmann: Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today. I will be there with @C_Lynne_Ryan your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm"
1887.  Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP. THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?
1888.  "@EnemyWithinn: @realDonaldTrump @elsolarverde @nytimes People gotta stop believing media lies about Trump." That would indeed be nice!
1889.  "@elsolarverde: THE CORRUPT MEDIA CREATS CONTROVERSY AGAINST @realDonaldTrump TO AVOID ISSUES ABOUT HillaryClinton https://t.co/RW5UcWLfA8"
1890.  "@SheriffClarke: https://t.co/G9R9CGhf8q Everything coming from this administration is a lie. Only @realDonaldTrump will change it"
1891.  Will be doing @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!
1892.  This is no surprise. Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off. The American people get it! https://t.co/a1A6XMfYx1
1893.  Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/cjivzdRpU1
1894.  Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
1895.  Reuters just announced that Secret Service never spoke to me or my campaign. Made up story by @CNN is a hoax. Totally dishonest.
1896.  "@DSF2020: Really admire your determination: Working so hard for all Americans n daily having to defend yourself from a biased Media."
1897.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/8rWz6p1Ged

1902.  My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas. #LESM
1903.  Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!
1904.  .@dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN. Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock
1905.  "@dbongino: ‘Now cut off my mic!’ Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump, 2nd Amendment – HEATED! https://t.co/UgtfaUXzcr"
1906.  Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
1907.  When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?
1908.  Thank you Senator @ChuckGrassley! #TrumpPence16
https://t.co/YmdH3fcaeW

1916.  "@sprts08: @realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends great interview.....all solid points on our economy TRUMP2016"
1917.  I am running against the Washington insiders, just like I did in the Republican Primaries. These are the people that have made U.S. a mess!
1918.  Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends now!
1919.  Being in Detroit today was wonderful. Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters. Just got back home!
1920.  RT @FieldofFight: We Can Do Better, We Must Do Better, We Will Do Better 
By LTG (R) Keith Kellogg and LTG (R) Michael Flynn @GenFlynn http…

1933.  #ICYMI: "Will Media Apologize to Trump?" https://t.co/ia7rKBmioA
1934.  Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C.I.A., and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky!
1935.  The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!
1936.  RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: CLINTON EMAIL LED TO EXECUTION IN IRAN? https://t.co/4rY1faptL6
1937.  I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard. Look at the job she has done in Baltimore. She is a joke!

https://t.co/I0zJO2sZKk
1942.  Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things!
1943.  Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED."
1944.  Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails. Very dangerous!
1945.  Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions. Let us all see what happens!

1956.  President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.  I won't dodge questions as your President. https://t.co/jsAMGO3s4P
1957.  Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
1958.  President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.

1988.  During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don’t want them heard. https://t.co/EHRiLkQDWD
1989.  When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
1990.  Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
1991.  Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. https://t.co/gJYSSXtpaz

1995.  People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
1996.  The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
1997.  Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
1998.  When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
1999.  CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
